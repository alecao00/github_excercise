A remote is simply a URL that points to an online repository that Git can track. We can give the remote any name but typically it is called `origin` because it is the \"source of truth\" that reflects the current state of the project where others copy from. To push to the registered remote we have to set it as upstream to mark it as a target to push to. Setting the upstream requires two inputs the remote repository (i.e. `origin`) and the branch we want to push. If you haven't created any branches there is only a single one and it is called either `main` (newer name) or `master` (older name).\n", "Once the upstream is registered we can use `git push` to push local changes to the remote repository. You can also register the upstream and push in a single command\n", "\n", "### Exercises\n", "\n", "In the following exercises you are going to create a new repository on GitHub, add it as a remote to you local repository and push it to the remote.
